Radiative Models
================

``naima`` contains several radiative models that can be used to compute the
non-thermal emission from populations of relativistic electrons or protons.
Below there is a brief explanation of each model, and full details on the
physics and motivation for the implementation can be found in the referenced
articles.

All the radiative models take a particle distribution function as a first
argument. Several particle distribution functions can be found in the
`naima.models` module: `~naima.models.PowerLaw`,
`~naima.models.ExponentialCutoffPowerLaw`, `~naima.models.LogParabola`,
`~naima.models.BrokenPowerLaw`, and
`~naima.models.ExponentialCutoffBrokenPowerLaw`. To use them as a particle
distribution function the units of their amplitude must be in particles per unit
energy (i.e., convertible to ``1/eV``). See below in `IC`_ for details about
the inverse Compton model.::

    >>> ECPL = naima.models.ExponentialCutoffPowerLaw(1e36*u.Unit('1/eV'), 1*u.TeV, 2.1, 13*u.TeV)
    >>> IC = naima.models.InverseCompton(ECPL, seed_photon_fields=['CMB'])

The parameters of the particle distribution can be accessed through the
``particle_distribution`` attribute of the radiative model, e.g.::

    >>> IC.particle_distribution.index = 1.8
    >>> print(ECPL.index)
    1.8

In addition, the same particle distribution instance can be used for several
radiative models simultaneously, for example when computing the synchrotron and
IC emission from an electron population::

    >>> SYN = naima.models.Synchrotron(ECPL, B=100*u.uG)
    >>> SYN.particle_distribution is IC.particle_distribution
    True

Once instantiated, the emission spectra from radiative models can be obtained
through the ``flux`` (differential flux) and ``sed`` (spectral energy
distribution) methods::

    >>> spectrum_energy = np.logspace(-1,14,1000)*u.eV
    >>> sed_IC = IC.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)
    >>> sed_SYN = SYN.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)

These spectra can then be analysed or plotted:

.. plot::

    import naima
    import astropy.units as u

    # Define models
    ECPL = naima.models.ExponentialCutoffPowerLaw(1e36*u.Unit('1/eV'),
            1*u.TeV, 2.1, 13*u.TeV)

    IC_CMB = naima.models.InverseCompton(ECPL, seed_photon_fields=['CMB'])
    IC_FIR = naima.models.InverseCompton(ECPL, seed_photon_fields=['FIR'])
    IC_NIR = naima.models.InverseCompton(ECPL, seed_photon_fields=['NIR'])
    IC_CMB.particle_distribution.index = 1.8
    SYN = naima.models.Synchrotron(ECPL, B=100*u.uG)

    # Compute SEDs
    spectrum_energy = np.logspace(-1,14,1000)*u.eV
    sed_IC_CMB = IC_CMB.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)
    sed_IC_FIR = IC_FIR.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)
    sed_IC_NIR = IC_NIR.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)
    sed_IC_tot = sed_IC_CMB + sed_IC_FIR + sed_IC_NIR
    sed_SYN = SYN.sed(spectrum_energy, distance=1.5*u.kpc)

.. _IC:

Inverse Compton radiative model
-------------------------------

The inverse Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons by relativistic electrons is
the main gamma-ray production channel for electron populations. Often, the seed
photon field will be a blackbody or a diluted blackbody, and the calculation of
IC must be done taking this into account. ``naima`` implements the analytical
approximations to IC upscattering of blackbody radiation developed by
`Khangulyan et al. (2014)`_. These have the advantage of being computationally
cheap compared to a numerical integration over the spectrum of the blackbody,
and remain accurate within one percent over a wide range of energies. Both the
isotropic IC and anisotropic IC approximations are available in ``naima``. If you
use this class in your research, please cite `Khangulyan, D., Aharonian, F.A., &
Kelner, S.R.  2014, Astrophysical Journal, 783, 100

The implementation in ``naima`` allows to specify which blackbody seed photon
fields to use in the calculation, and provides the three dominant galactic
photon fields at the location of the Solar System through the `CMB` (Cosmic
Microwave Background), `FIR` (far-infrared dust emission), and `NIR`
(near-infrared stellar emission) keywords. The seed photon fields can be
selected though the `seed_photon_fields` parameter of the
`~naima.models.InverseCompton` model. This parameter should be provided with a
list of items, each of which can be either:

    * A string equal to ``CMB`` (default), ``NIR``, or ``FIR``, for which
      radiation fields with temperatures of 2.72 K, 70 K, and 5000 K, and
      energy densities of 0.261, 0.5, and 1 eV/cmÂ³ will be used, or

    * A list of length three (isotropic source) or four (anisotropic source)
      composed of:

        1. A name for the seed photon field
        2. Its temperature as a :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` float
           instance.
        3. Its photon field energy density as a
           :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` float instance. If the photon
           field energy density if set to 0, its blackbody energy density
           will be computed through the Stefan-Boltzman law.
        4. Optional: The angle between the seed photon direction and the scattered
           photon direction as a :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` float
           instance. If this is provided, the anisotropic IC differential
           cross-section will be used.

.. _PP:

Pion Decay radiative model
--------------------------

The main gamma-ray production for relativistic protons are p-p interactions
followed by pion decay, which results in a photon with :math:`E_\gamma >
100\,\mathrm{MeV}`. Until recently, the only parametrizations available for the
integral cross-section and photon emission spectra were either only applicable
to limited energy ranges, or were given as extensive numerical tables (e.g.,
`Kelner et al. (2006) <http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2006PhRvD..74c4018K>`_;
`Kamae et al. (2006) <http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2006ApJ...647..692K>`_).
By considering Monte Carlo results and a compilation of accelerator data on p-p
interactions, `Kafexhiu et al. (2014)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhRvD..90l3014K>`_ were able to develop
analytic parametrizations to the energy spectra and production rates of gamma
rays from p-p interactions. The `~naima.models.PionDecay` class uses an
implementation of the formulae presented in their paper, and gives the choice of
which high-energy model to use (from the parametrization to the different Monte
Carlo results) through the `hiEmodel` parameter. If you use this class, please
