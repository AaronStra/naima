``gammafit`` uses MCMC fitting of non-thermal X-ray, GeV, and TeV spectra to
constrain the properties of their parent relativistic particle distributions. 

The workhorse of ``gammafit`` is the powerful `emcee
<http://dan.iel.fm/emcee>`_ affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain
Monte Carlo.

TODO: Explain briefly the radiation models and emcee fitting
